  <h1>Vacation Trips</h1>
  <p>
    Since 1945 the club has been leading vacation trips, usually to the UK
    National Parks (most commonly the Lakes, Peaks & Snowdonia) with the Easter
    Break being the most common time. These trips usually last 5-7 days and
    involve staying in one or more youth hostels. More history of the trips will
    be added to this page in time. There were no trips from 2018-2023 with a
    resurrection to the Easter Ramble in 2024 with a trip to the Hope Valley
    (peak district).

    The 2024 Summer trip will be to the South Downs National Park in Sussex and
    will take place on the 15-20th September. The trip will involve
    <a style="color: blue" href="files/Summer%20Ramble%202024.pdf">5-6 walks</a
    >. We will be staying in YHA South Downs in Southease which will cost Â£65-85
    each depending on our exact numbers. This will be payable once your place is
    confirmed (non-refundable unless someone is able to take your place). The
    sign up form for the trip can be found
    <a style="color: blue" href="https://forms.gle/vFMUK3aWE5fNE1zr5">here</a>.

    Spaces will be limited to 10. The form will remain open until 23:59 on
    Sunday 21st July (and beyond if spaces remain). If the trip is
    oversubscribed places will first go to those who filled out the pre-sign-up
    form which was sent out in June then the rest will be allocated by lot
    (trying not to split up people who ask to be together).
