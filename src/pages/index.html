  <h1>Cambridge University Rambling Club</h1>

  <p>
    We are a friendly, informal society composed of people who enjoy walking
    through the British countryside. During the University term, we host walks
    every weekend - many of our rambles are around East Anglia with occasional
    trips further afield. In addition to our &pound;1 annual membership fee,
    your only expense will be the bus or train fare for each ramble. New members
    are always very welcome, whether you're a member of the University or not,
    and you can join the club on any walk! To become a member simply fill out
    the
    <a href="https://forms.gle/PijWdgc7zHPNXqbx7">membership form</a>
    and transfer the &pound;1 fee to the account details given. (Note you can
    attend 1 ramble before becoming a member to act as a taster.)
  </p>

  <p>
    For walks that start from the train station, we meet just outside the main
    doors of the station. (Train tickets are typically purchased for the group
    by the walk leader to utilise the GroupSave discount.) For walks that start
    from the bus station, we meet at the corner of Drummer St and Emmanuel St.
  </p>

  <p>
    You should typically bring a packed lunch and a drink, strong boots and
    waterproof clothing are also highly recommended, particularly in winter.

    Every year, the rambling club also organises the
    <a href="3_varsity.html">Varsity March</a>, an 81 mile, non-stop walk from
    Oxford to Cambridge! More information about all our events can be found by
    clicking the links on the right, and most are also listed on our
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cambridgerambling/">Facebook</a>
