          <h1>Cambridge University Rambling Club</h1>

          <p>
            We are a friendly, informal society composed of people who enjoy
            walking through the British countryside. During the University term,
            we host walks every weekend - many of our rambles are around East
            Anglia with occasional trips further afield. In addition to our
            &pound;1 annual membership fee, your only expense will be the bus or
            train fare for each ramble. New members are always very welcome,
            whether you're a member of the University or not, and you can join
            the club on any walk! To become a member simply fill out the
            <a href="https://forms.gle/PijWdgc7zHPNXqbx7">membership form</a>
            and transfer the &pound;1 fee to the account details given. (Note
            you can attend 1 ramble before becoming a member to act as a
            taster.)
          </p>

          <p>
            For walks that start from the train station, we meet just outside
            the main doors of the station. (Train tickets are typically
            purchased for the group by the walk leader to utilise the GroupSave
            discount.) For walks that start from the bus station, we meet at the
            corner of Drummer St and Emmanuel St.
          </p>

          <p>
            You should typically bring a packed lunch and a drink, strong boots
            and waterproof clothing are also highly recommended, particularly in
            winter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every year, the rambling club also organises the
            <a href="3_varsity.html">Varsity March</a>, an 81 mile, non-stop
            walk from Oxford to Cambridge! More information about all our events
            can be found by clicking the links on the right, and most are also
            listed on our
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cambridgerambling/">Facebook</a>
            and

            rambles.
