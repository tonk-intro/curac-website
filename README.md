The CURaC Website was redesgned in 2018. It looked nice but there were two problems:

1. It was created with the help of some HTML generator and the code was a mess. The CSS file was nearly 3000 lines long, plus lots of inline-CSS, much of which didn't seem to really do anything.
2. The site didn't really work on mobile phones.

In 2024 I thus re-implemented the design. We now make do with around 300 lines of CSS and so changing the layout has become easy. A collapsable menu makes the site responsive for small screens.

In addition to the design itself there are two very basic scripts for page generation and deployment.
